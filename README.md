A JavaScript library for reactive programming using React-like Hooks.

## Installation

Using `yarn`:

```
yarn add ironhook
```

Using `npm`:

```
npm install ironhook --save
```

## Motivation

Reactive programming is generally understood to be programming using
asynchronous data streams, which form the conceptual basis for libraries like
[RxJS][rxjs] or [xstream][xstream]. In React, however, reactive programming is
not about dealing with streams, but with so-called
[Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html#motivation).

A component is rendered, whereby side effects are declared based on its current
state (using the
[`useEffect`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html#effect-hook) Hook),
which in turn can lead to state changes (using the
[`useState`](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html#state-hook) Hook) and
thus to further renderings.

In contrast to the concept of streams, the concept of Hooks was something I
liked from the beginning. I find them very intuitive to read and write. I wanted
to use this kind of reactive programming in other areas as well, for example for
programming web workers, AWS Lambda handlers, or even JavaScript-controlled
robots. Therefore I wrote this library.

[xstream]: https://github.com/staltz/xstream

## Usage Example

The following is a constructed example that demonstrates the use of this
library:

```js
import {Subject, useEffect, useState} from 'ironhook';

function useName() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('World');

  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => setName('John Doe'), 10);
  }, []);

  return name;
}

const subject = new Subject(useName);

subject.subscribe({
  next: name => console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`),
  error: error => console.error('Oops!', error),
  complete: () => console.log('Bye.')
});
```

Output:

```
Hello, World!
Hello, John Doe!
```

## API Reference

The [React Hooks API reference](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html)
also applies to this library and should be consulted.

### Implementation Status

React:

### Implementation Notes

This library implements the
[observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern):

> The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, called
> the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and
> notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of
> their methods.

The main difference to React is that this library calls a Hook (aka `mainHook`)
directly, without the need for a surrounding function component. The first
execution of the `mainHook` is scheduled as a microtask (i.e. asynchronous)
after the first call of `Subject.subscribe(observer)`. All further executions
can be scheduled internally with the `useState` or `useReducer` Hooks. The
`mainHook` continues to run, i.e. it maintains its state and is re-executed on
state changes until an error is thrown or the `Subject.complete()` method is
called. An error or completion has the same effect as unmounting a React
function component.

### Types

```ts
class Subject<TValue> {
  /**
   * This promise is resolved both in the case of an error
   * and after normal completion.
   */
  readonly completion: Promise<void>;

  constructor(mainHook: MainHook<TValue>);

  subscribe(observer: Observer<TValue>): Unsubscribe;
  complete(): void;
}
```

```ts
type MainHook<TValue> = () => TValue;
```

```ts
interface Observer<TValue> {
  next(value: TValue): void;
  error(error: Error): void;
  complete(): void;
}
```

```ts
type Unsubscribe = () => void;
```

**Note:** The `Observer` interface is intentionally compatible with the
[`Observer`](https://rxjs.dev/api/index/interface/Observer) from RxJS and the
[`Listener`](http://staltz.github.io/xstream/#listener) from xstream.

## Development

### Publish A New Release

```
yarn release patch
```

```
yarn release minor
```

```
yarn release major
```

After a new release has been created by pushing the tag, it must be published
via the GitHub UI. This triggers the final publication to npm.
